            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> I am beginning my journey in computer science with the vision of becoming a skilled and 
                creative game developer. My mission is to build a strong foundation in programming, 
                problem-solving, and design while nurturing my passion for storytelling and interactive 
                experiences. I aim to grow through curiosity, persistence, and collaboration, embracing 
                challenges as opportunities to learn. My goal is to contribute to the gaming world by 
                creating innovative, meaningful, and enjoyable experiences that connect people and 
                inspire imagination.</p></div>
