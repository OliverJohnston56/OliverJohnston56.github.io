            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am beginning my journey in computer science with the vision of becoming a skilled and 
                creative game developer. My mission is to build a strong foundation in programming, 
                problem-solving, and design while nurturing my passion for storytelling and interactive 
                experiences. I aim to grow through curiosity, persistence, and collaborationâ€”embracing 
                challenges as opportunities to learn. My goal is to contribute to the gaming world by 
                creating innovative, meaningful, and enjoyable experiences that connect people and 
                inspire imagination.</p></div>
